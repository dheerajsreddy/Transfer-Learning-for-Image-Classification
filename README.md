This project implements a multi-class image classifier using transfer learning with pre-trained models (ResNet50, ResNet101, EfficientNetB0, VGG16). The classifier distinguishes between 6 categories and achieves a test accuracy of 91% by incorporating data augmentation and regularization techniques.

Key Highlights:

Utilized pre-trained models for fine-tuning.

Applied data augmentation and regularization to enhance performance.

Achieved significant accuracy improvements.
